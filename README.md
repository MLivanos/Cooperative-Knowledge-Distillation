# Cooperative Knowledge Distillation: A Learner Agnostic Approach

Code for the AAAI24 paper: Cooperative Knowledge Distillation: A Learner Agnostic Approach by Michael Livanos, Ian Davidson, and Stephen Wong at the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Davis.

Currently, the main file is a PyNotebook for experiments one and two of the paper. While the existing code can be leveraged for use of our approach, future work on this repo will faciliate the use of our method.

Also note the filepath set in section 1 of the Pynotebook and adjust to your preference if you chose to run this code yourself. The code assumes use on Google Colab and accessing datasets via Google Drive. Please reach out to Michael Livanos for questions about the code.
